### Introduction

This is a test repository to learn about the working of the NestJS using the Nomad Coders free course.

Here, we learned about creating an API endpoints, testing them using the Jest, as well as doing the end-to-end testing. We haven't used any database in this example. This is a simple example for the beginner who are learning the NestJS.

The good thing about this course is, you get to learn about the unit testing as well as the e2e testing along with the basic API creation.
